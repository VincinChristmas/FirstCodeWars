/*Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, 
but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. 
Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, 
and is trying to get the neighborhood association to pay for it. He begins 
to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the wall. 
Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, 
and can only remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, 
he insists that his neighbors keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.

Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name 
as an array. If the number of the characters in name is less than or equal to two, 
it will return an array containing only the name as is"
*/

//My Solution
function whoIsPaying(name){
  //your code here
  let displayName = [];
  if (name.length > 2) {
    displayName.push(name, name.slice(0,2))
  } else {
    displayName.push(name.slice(0))
  }
  return displayName

/*
Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. it must make the first character in the string upper case).

The string will always start with a letter and will never be empty.

Examples:
*/
//my soulution
function capitalizeWord(word) {
  let newChar = word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);

  return newChar;

//The problem: 
/*
You get any card as an argument. Your task is to return the suit of this card (in lowercase).

Our deck (is preloaded):

('3♣') -> return 'clubs'
('3♦') -> return 'diamonds'
('3♥') -> return 'hearts'
('3♠') -> return 'spades'

//My solution:

function defineSuit(card) {
  // good luck
  if(card.includes('♣') === true) {
    return 'clubs'
  } else if (card.includes('♦') === true) {

// Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.
