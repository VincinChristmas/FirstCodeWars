/*
For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. 
If there are one or two good ideas, 
return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'.
 If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

/*
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can 
assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

Examples
"Hi!"     ---> "Hi"
"Hi!!!"   ---> "Hi!!"
"!Hi"     ---> "!Hi"
"!Hi!"    ---> "!Hi"
"Hi! Hi!" ---> "Hi! Hi"
"Hi"      ---> "Hi"

hotter than the sun!!, else, return Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.

Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages).

//NUMBER SIX!!!!!!
//This is an 8kyu kata string problem
/*
It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

*/


//My Solution:
function joinStrings(string1, string2){
  // code here
 return `${string1} ${string2}`
}

// NUMBER FIVE!!!!!!
//This is an 8kyu kata problem
/*Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, 
but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. 
Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, 
and is trying to get the neighborhood association to pay for it. He begins 
to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the wall. 
Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, 
and can only remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, 
he insists that his neighbors keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.

Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name 
as an array. If the number of the characters in name is less than or equal to two, 
it will return an array containing only the name as is"

//My Solution
function whoIsPaying(name){

/*
Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. it must make the first character in the string upper case).

The string will always start with a letter and will never be empty.

Examples:
